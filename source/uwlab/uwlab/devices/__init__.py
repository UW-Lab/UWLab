"""Sub-package providing interfaces to different teleoperation devices.

Currently, the following categories of devices are supported:

* **Se3Keyboard**: Standard keyboard with WASD and arrow keys.
* **RealsenseT265**: Realsense cameras 6 degrees of freedom.
* **RokokoGlove**: Rokoko gloves that track position and quaternion of the hand.

All device interfaces inherit from the :class:`isaaclab.devices.DeviceBase` class, which provides a
common interface for all devices. The device interface reads the input data when
the :meth:`DeviceBase.advance` method is called. It also provides the function :meth:`DeviceBase.add_callback`
to add user-defined callback functions to be called when a particular input is pressed from
the peripheral device.
