    The function finds flat patches of given radius based on the search space defined by the input ranges.

    The function performs rejection sampling to find the patches based on the following steps:

    1. Sample patch locations in the 2D region around the origin.
    2. Define a ring of points around each patch location to query the height of the points using ray-casting.
