def create_axis_remap_function(forward: str = "x", left: str = "y", up: str = "z", device: str = "cpu"):
    """Creates a function to remap and reorient the axes of input tensors.

    This function generates a new function that remaps the axes of input tensors
    according to the specified forward, left, and up axes. The resulting
    function can be used to reorder and reorient both positional and rotational data.

    Args:
        forward: The axis that should be mapped to the primary axis (e.g., "x" or "-x").
        left: The axis that should be mapped to the secondary axis (e.g., "y" or "-y").
        up: The axis that should be mapped to the tertiary axis (e.g., "z" or "-z").
        device: The device on which the resulting tensors will be processed (e.g., "cpu" or "cuda").

    Returns:
        A function that takes two tensors as inputs:
        - positions (torch.Tensor): A positional tensor of shape (N, 3).
        - rotations (torch.Tensor): A rotational tensor of shape (N, 3).

        The output function returns a tuple containing:
        - new_positions (torch.Tensor): The remapped positional tensor of shape (N, 3).
        - new_rotations (torch.Tensor): The remapped rotational tensor of shape (N, 3).

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            new_positions, new_rotations = remap_fn(positions, rotations)
